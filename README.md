# Karpathy neuralnets python code
Python code accompanying Andrew Karpathy's great [Hacker's guide to Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/)

Please check out this great beginners tutorial if you haven't already.

This code is only for reference, one day in your life you have to write it yourself to really dig/own it.

Some but not all of the examples make use of the http://tensorflow.org/ framework for experimentation/demonstration purposes.
For pure python code see  linear_regression.py, Backprop_Ninja.py,	nn_4neurons.py or [here](https://github.com/urwithajit9/HG_NeuralNetwork/blob/master/NN_as_hacker.py).
